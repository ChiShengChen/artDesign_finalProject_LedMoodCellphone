# artDesign_finalProject_LedMoodCellphone


This the final project for class Contemporary Art and Cross-Disciplinary Design in NCTU.

## Concept
This work we try to expound technology indifference with the leds and cellphone control. In other words, I wrote a android app to get the z-axis data from gyroscope sensor in the cellphone, when someone pick up the phone, which let the z-axis velocity > 1, the phone will sent a string "rain" through bluetooth to the device and let it blink the blue light.

On the other hand, when someone put down their cellphone, which let the z-axis velocity < 1, the phone will sent a string "sun" through bluetooth to the device and let it blink the red light.
